# Flutter Drawer Widget

This Flutter application demonstrates the usage of the **Drawer widget**.

The Drawer widget is a material design panel that slides in from the edge of the screen. It's typically used to provide navigation options or quick links to different parts of your application. Think of it like a hidden sidebar that appears when you tap an icon (usually a "hamburger" icon) or swipe from the edge of the screen. It's an essential UI component for apps with multiple sections or features.

## How to Run the Application

Follow these simple steps to get the application up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dianepretty/drawer_widget
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd drawer_widget
    ```
3.  **Run the Flutter application:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
